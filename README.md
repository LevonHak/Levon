So there's a game named Battle of Warships, which has 2 players and each players has a board where players ships placed.
 This project code was fully made only with JS and the boards are placed in console, where ships are valued 1 and the free place is valued 0's.
 When the game starts, it takes a randomly guess which player has to start the game.
 The game continues until someones board are no 1's at all
